# OIBSIP-lvl1proj3-sentiment_analysis
Crafting a sentiment analysis model to classify text sentiment accurately, offering insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends.


In pursuit of developing a sentiment analysis model, I utilized an app script sourced from the internet to analyze text data extracted from Twitter. Leveraging Google's Natural Language Processor, the script systematically processed the text, categorizing it based on sentiment. This approach enabled me to gain insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and emerging trends on social media platforms. Through this endeavor, I aimed to enhance understanding of sentiment dynamics and facilitate informed decision-making processes.
